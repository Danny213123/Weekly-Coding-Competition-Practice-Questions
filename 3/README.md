A factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n, where n is a positive integer.
A factorial is denoted as n!

For example, 3! = 3*2*1; 5! = 5*4*3*2*1; etc.

You are working for the School's Math Department, and are tasked with creating a program that finds the factorial of a number. Since the school you attend does not recognize prime numbers as real numbers, you are tasked with creating a calculator that outputs the factorial of a number without it's prime constituents. For example, given the number 20, it's factorial at your school is 20*18*16*15*14*12*10*9*8*6*4*1.

The school wants to be able to find the factorials of all the numbers from 1-100
