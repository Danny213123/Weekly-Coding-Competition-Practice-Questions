Hello Everyone, I know it's been a while, but I've been working on a decrypting question. As a filler, I've come up with this:

You have been selected to represent your school as the obstacle course runner that was recently added this year. The obstacle course is the size of a square, 300m by 300m. The course starts with an x amount of obstacles, and every lap that is completed, y amount of obstacles are removed.  The obstacle course ends when the runner finishes a lap with no obstacles. Assume that you run at a constant speed of z (m/s) (including start and finish) and each obstacle takes 2 extra seconds to pass (the obstacles do not slow you down). How long would it take you to finish the whole obstacle course?

Input will look like this where x is the amount of obstacles, y is the amount of obstacles removed per lap, and z is the speed of the runner (in m/s):
20 2 5
The output will be the amount of time it'll take to finish the obstacle course (in seconds)
Output: 2860

SAMPLE INPUTS:

      1. INPUT: 10 5 3
          OUTPUT: 1230

      2. INPUT: 50 10 2
          OUTPUT: 3900

      3. INPUT: 8 1 5
          OUTPUT: 2232

      4. INPUT: 5 5 2
          OUTPUT: 1210

      5. INPUT: 300 20 10
          OUTPUT: 6720
